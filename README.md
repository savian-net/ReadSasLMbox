# ReadSasLMbox

### Background

Based upon a discussion on SAS-L around September 2023 on how to get the SAS-L Archives into the public domain. 

Barry Grau said:

*SAS-L and comp.soft-sys-sas usenet groups used to be gatewayed in both directions.*
*Go here: https://archive.org/download/usenet-comp*
*Scroll to comp.soft-sys.sas.mbox.zip(or just click on the link here)*

### Purpose

Reads the SAS-L mailbox stored at usenet and creates a SQLite DB.
